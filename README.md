The main objective of this project is to unveil the evolutionary role of associated and/or symbiotic bacteria and fungi in the successful conquest of land by crabs and, ultimately, to share light on the importance of such association/symbioses for the evolution of terrestrial habits by animals in general.

## Project abstract

The transition to terrestrial environments by formerly aquatic species has occurred repeatedly in all animal groups and lead to the vast biodiversity of terrestrial forms that we are observing nowadays. The differences between aquatic and terrestrial habitats are enormous and nearly every facet of life was altered to cope with the water-to-land transition. In morphological and physiological terms, animals belonging to rather different and unrelated taxa are known to share very similar adaptations to land, but nothing is known about the critical role of commensal and symbiotic microbiota in such transition. The holobiont theory of evolution indicates that evolution acts on both the genes of the host and of the commensal microbiota, termed microbiome. Terrestrial crabs are a perfect model to study the evolutionary pathways and the ecological role of animal-microbiome symbioses (the so called symbiomes), since the evolution of crabs towards the conquest of terrestrial environments is happening right now through a number of non-related groups.
